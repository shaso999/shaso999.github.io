<h1>Cyberpunkish?</h1> 
<p>An attempt to make a cyberpunk world that makes any sense.</p>

<h1>Background</h1> 
<h2>Guide to Seattle</h2> 
<p><em>Excerpted from &quot;The Fire and the Future, Seattle in the 90s,and the decade that changed the world&quot;</em></p> 
<h3>1994 Cadabra is Born</h3> 
<p>The second newest of the big four tech firms in Seattle, this retail giant was founded by Jeff &amp; MacKenzie in 1994. While their original plan may have been to sell books, they would quickly seize on the wave of awakening in their backyard to propel their firm to the behemoth which runs half the worlds websites, and delivers more packages then the USPS, DHL, and UPS combined. </p> 
<h3>1995 IONS founded</h3> 
<p>The most recent, and possibly most influential of the big four, IONS was formally incorporated in 1995. It inherited the patents and groundbreaking work of Michael Bertiaux and Howard Rheingold, which would form the basis of both the awakening, magic, and modern cybernetics today. CEO Willis Harman then took the bold step of combining all of these patents into a single unified pool, with a fixed fee, open to anyone who wished to utilize the technology, setting the groundwork for the company&rsquo;s future wealth, and making it into the R&amp;D giant that continues to be integral to most advancements in technology today.</p> 
<h3>1996 The Father of All Demos</h3> 
<p>While the patents were filed and theoretically open to all a year earlier, it was this presentation to a UW auditorium in July of 1996 which would set off the boom that subsequently consumed the world. Over the course of an hour Willis Harman demonstrated both the finished Obsidian and Ruby implants, giving birth to the modern mages and hackers respectively, along with the first practical examples of cybernetic enhancement. While the broader public would remain skeptical of both the truth and usefulness of these discoveries for years to come, the local business community was sold, kicking off the first boom. </p> 
<h3>1999 United States v. Microsoft Corp.</h3> 
<p>While the case itself was quickly overshadowed by Black December, the division of Microsoft would have massive implications for the local economy, and create the big four as we know them today. No longer shackled by having to promote an operating system, the new Microsoft would rapidly expand into new areas of growth, launching new ERP, finance, and multimedia software, and becoming the omnipresent element of all of our lives. And Windows Corp, now left with one major stream of revenue, found itself forced to both expand its offerings for operating environments both larger servers, smaller mobile devices, and all manner of integrated applications in-between. Not to mention the launch of their Portal cloud environments, making them integral to the modern internet.</p> 
<h3>1999 1/12 (Battle for Seattle)</h3> 
<p>The WTO meetings in Seattle were contentious from the start. Even before 1/12 there was demonstrating, rioting, and pitched battles with police all around the sites of the meetings. It was becoming increasing clear that the police were losing control of the situation when Bill Clinton made the fateful decision to attend the sessions on 1/12 in person. As the president exited his convoy to a crowd of the worlds press, no one was expecting a man to suddenly appear behind him holding a sword, let alone for that man to decapitate the sitting president and disappear just as suddenly. </p> 
<p>It would take nearly a week before it was clear that the anarchist and black block groups organizing the demonstrations were not responsible, but instead the awakened terrorists of the Invisible Committee. But in that time the reaction was swift and harsh, with thousands being held without trial, and nearly 10 blocks of downtown being heavily damaged or abandoned in the ensuing clean up operations.<br /></p> 
<h3>1999 YTK</h3> 
<p>The city was still in the early stages of recovery from the battle of Seattle, when the final chapter of Black December came to a close. In a matter of minutes more then half the computers in the city were no longer operating, and 73% of the city found itself without power for nearly three days. While this further delayed the attempts to rebuild the city, more immediately this served as the final catalyst for President Gore to declare the war on terror, plunging the USA and Seattle into the 21st century. </p> 
<h2>The Game</h2> 
<p><em>Archived from the 3chan general interest board on July 25th, 2024</em></p> 
<p><em>Posted [2024:07:24:21:34:12]</em></p> 
<p>Screw it, storytime. I am so tired of all these terrible threads talking about deniable assets, and the jobs that they pull, which are 90% lies, and 10% shit you looked up on backrub, which are also lies. So now that I am out of the game, lets set the record straight about how real operators conduct business. </p> 
<p><em>Posted [2024:07:24:21:37:36] </em></p> 
<p>So first you need a brief history lesson, my old profession did not really start with the awakening, or with the internet, or with cybernetics, or any other discovery. No those all played in to it, but my profession started on January 4th, 2000 when President Gore signed the SECURITY act. That bill required anyone who was awakened to register with the federal government, and provide regular updates on their location and employment. Which split the burgeoning community of more abled into two camps, those the government knew about, and those they did not. That second group suddenly found itself without legitimate means of employment, but with a suddenly enhanced market position for committing crimes. No longer could a hacker decide to just liberate a savings and loans institution of its surplus currency on a whim, if you were on the books they would find you, and if you weren&rsquo;t you better get good at it, since it is now your job.</p> 
<p>And hire us they did, because in a world where only one in 50,000 has the talent to begin with, its a lot easier to go on the offense and hire a heavy for a day, then to hire a straight for 10 years on the off chance your attacked.</p> 
<p>Posted [2024:07:24:21:40:02]<br /></p> 
<p>So if you are a young person, with a lack of documentation, flexible morals, and a Jordan Belfort esc desire to get rich, how do you start. Well first you need a crew. One person working on their own is very unlikely to to able to accomplish much beyond serving as target practice. Then you need to find a fixer. This is the disreputable individual who will put you in contact with you&rsquo;re employer. Said employer will then give you a job, and a you can either take it, not take it, or try and haggle them up on the price. And I recommend going hard on the second and third of those, there is nothing forcing you to take a job, and there is nothing forcing you to take a job at a bad price. </p> 
<p>Posted [2024:07:24:21:43:56]<br /></p> 
<blockquote>Being aggressive with an employer seems like a great way to never get work again.</blockquote> 
<p>Ya this is what I was talking about before, this movie crap. It is the employers literal job to haggle, and deal with the disappointment of teams backing out on them. If they reacted to normal everyday business as a personal slight they will be out of a job in 6 months. Also while we are at it, it is also not crucial that you are in the dark on the real entity that is playing for your services. The crucial part is that no one can prove the company paid you, you figuring out who the company is, is irrelevant, and if your employer is going to a lot of lengths to hide that, its a massive red flag.</p> 
<p>Which brings us to the final part of this, actually carrying out the job. First you need to plan heavily for how you are going to pull this off. You advantage as the attacker is that your opponents don&rsquo;t know when and where you are striking, so maximize that and figure out ahead of time where and when to go in. This isn&rsquo;t a fucking movie, people who go in and wing it end up in jail, or dead, or dead in jail. </p> 
<p>On a related note, shooting people like your Hans Gruber is also a terrible idea. This isn&rsquo;t some 80s action vehicle, if you shoot someone in the face that is murder. So unless for some terrible reason you have decided to go after some third world military, or attack an Oracle Zero Zone, stick to the non-lethal options if you don&rsquo;t want all the 3 letter agencies trying to give you a field colonoscopy.<br /></p> 
<p>Then once you have done the thing, you get to go back to get your money. No there is this weird idea that this is when your employer is going to try and stiff you, which is insane. If they do that word will get out, and they will not be hiring anyone again. If they are going to fuck you over, they are going to do it during the job. That said, best practice is to hold onto the item until the cash clears.</p> 
<h2>Magic</h2> 
<p><em>Willis Harman&rsquo;s Testimony to the Rehnquist Commission</em><br /></p> 
<p>What is magic? There are several things that this commission has asked me to explain or illuminate today in the light of recent tragic events but this seems to be the most fundamental. So what is magic? I could claim that its life, that its power, that its will and all of that is true, but as in many things my now deceased friend and colleague Michael Bertiaux put it best with his 11 Commandments:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Magic Comes from Focused Will</li> 
<li>Magic is Fueled from Life</li> 
<li>Magic Takes Effort equal to its effect by the efficiency to the 8th power</li> 
<li>Magic Cannot Create more Life</li> 
<li>Magic Cannot Create a Soul</li> 
<li>Magic Cannot Manipulate Time</li> 
<li>Magic Cannot Remove Matter from Reality</li> 
<li>The Soul is Inherent to it&rsquo;s form, to Change it is to Destroy it</li> 
<li>To Observe Something is to Change it</li> 
<li>A Soul Once Destroyed Cannot be Restored</li> 
<li>To Destroy the Soul is to Kill</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Any question you have is answered there. Can you bring back the dead? No, nor can you speak or commune with them. Can you go back in time? No, with all respect to Marty McFly it&rsquo;s functionally impossible, as is going forward or sideways, and attempts at prophesy or fortune telling also fail. What about teleportation? Well our friends at the postal service can rest easy because that to is beyond our keen. Well surely you say we can enchant an object, a sword or a mirror, or even just a broom? Alas no object has a mind of it&rsquo;s own and without a mind to hold it the power just seeps away. And any attempt to ape Dr Frankenstein and make a golem, or to control others minds, or any other trick best seen in a Hammer Horror Film also do not work. Even attempts to directly heal the sick often are not possible. The body is a powerful thing, and while you can often restore something damaged, your body may well see Leukemia as working as intended. </p> 
<p>Apart from those rules though, well you can do anything, if you have a discipline and the power. Move at impossible speeds, lift impossible objects, summon spirits to assist you, even Fly. Just don&rsquo;t ask me to read your mind. </p> 
<h1>Savage Worlds Ruleset</h1> 
<p>This is the demo ruleset for running this setting in savage worlds.</p> 
<h2>Races</h2> 
<p>The races in this setting represent which of the awakened options your character has taken. Options are Hacker, Driver, Heavy, Mage, Summoner, Super, Regular.</p> 
<h3 class="e">Hacker</h3> 
<p class="g"><em>Where most people see the internet through screens and machines, you see the internet by jacking in, or for the newer kids getting close enough to a WIFI spot.</em></p> 
<p class="e">You are able to take the Hacking (Smarts) Skill. </p> 
<p class="e">You can take Hacker Edges</p> 
<p class="e">You have a derived stat 'Firewall', equal to 2 + Hacking/2</p>
<p class="f"><br/></p>
<h3 class="e">Driver</h3> 
<p class="g"><em>The average person these days relies on their car to drive itself, where you tell 20 cars where to drive themselves. Not only can you control multiple devices at the same time, you can also jump into a specific device and pilot it like you were there, useful assuming your smarter then whatever the lowest bidder wrote for the AI.</em></p> 
<p class="e">The total number of cars/drones/boats/devices you can control is theoretically unlimited, but you can only give direction to a number of groups equal to half your smarts die (so d6 is 3 groups)</p> 
<p class="e">You can also at any point jump into a specific device, in which case you may now roll and take all checks for the vehicle using your own stats and wild die, at plus 1. </p> 
<p class="e">You can take Driver Edges</p>

<p class="e">You can take Mage Edges</p> 
<p class="f"><br/></p>

<p class="e">You can take Summoner Edges</p>

<h2>Gear</h2>
<p>We are not tracking money in this game. Instead of purchasing a fixed amount of gear, you can take anything that it reasonable for your character subject to the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should fit what your characters background and role is (a summoner probably would not have a mil-spec rifle)</li>
<li>Common gear, Modern Melee Weapons, Modern Ranged Weapons, Modern Firearms excluding lasers, flamethrowers, grenades, mines, missiles, rocket launchers, non-futuristic vehicular weapons, and any civilian vehicle are all in</li>
<li>Military vehicles, and the pilot vehicles noted below are only available to pilots by taking edges</li>
<li>Armor is limited to the listing below</li>
<li>There are other alternative ammo types and items below<br /></li>
<li>Please retheme any of these items to better fit the setting, but the mechanics of an assault rifle have not changed much</li>
</ul>
<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>The following items are available to players:</p>
<p>Bullet Resistant Clothing (Armor: 0, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5, Special: +2 armor against bullets, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabric garment)</p>
<p>Stab Resistant Clothing (Armor: 0, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5, Special: +2 armor stab and slashing attacks, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabric garment)<br /></p>
<p>Light Combat Armor (Armor: 2, Min Str.: d6, weight: 12, Special: +2 armor against bullets, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabric garment)</p>
<p>Heavy Combat Armor (Armor: 4, Min Str.: d8, weight: 25, Special: +2 armor against bullets)</p>
<p>Riot Shield (Parry: +3, Cover: -4, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5) </p>
<p>Riot Shield (Parry: +3, Cover: -4, Min Str.: d6, weight: 9, Special: +4 to armor if the attack is a bullet, and it goes through the riot shield)<br /></p>
<h3>Other Items</h3>
<p>Rhino Rounds (These pressurized rounds go off with concussive force when they make contact with the opponent, knocking them off their feet. Can be fired from modern firearms, the weapon loses all AP, non-lethal, if an attack would normally wound a target (second shaken or with a raise) stun them instead)</p>
<p>Lightning Rounds (These gel filled rounds carry a strong electric charge, immobilizing opposing targets. Can be fired from modern firearms, the weapon loses all AP, but now deals non-lethal damage, which goes against the fatigue track)</p>
<h2>Driver Vehicles</h2>
<p>This section outlines the drones and other vehicles available to Drivers. Unlike normal vehicles which come basically unmodified from large manufacturers, drivers take basic vehicle models and extensively customize them. Note that the base options are split into drones, and vehicles. Vehicles follow the normal rules from the core book, drones are instead created like human extras.</p>
<p>All of these craft have several ratings. First there is handling, which is a flat bonus to any rolls to maneuver the craft in question. Second there is AI, which is the die type used on any checks from the craft. Third is wounds, which overrides the normal rules for extras going out in one hit. Fourth is capacity, which indicates how many capacity points of gear can be attached to the craft from the subsequent chart. Fifth is category, which sets out what groups of equipment are available to each vehicle.</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2> 
<p>This section outlines how hacking works in this setting. This primarily impacts characters playing hackers, but has implications for the general way computer networks work.</p>
<p>Each computer, camera, server, device is a 'node'. If you control the node then you have access to all the data on it, and can give commands to it, and anything controlled by it. Each node has a number of 'connections' which link it to other nodes and the outside world. For example if you have a machine that controls security cameras, it might have a physical port that is a connection, a line connection to the server in the building, and a connection to the public internet. All abilities or attempts to influence a machine require you to use one of these connections. If it is physical, you need to be plugged in, or in wifi range, if it is to the net you need to have access to the internet, and if it is to another system, you need to either control or occupy that system. A hacker is in the most recent system they have operated on, without jacking out.</p>
<p>A hacker is in the most recent system they have operated on, without jacking out. So if I just hacked the camera computer, that is the system I am in. A hacker on their action can move between any controlled connected nodes freely before taking an action. If the hacker is acting normally (not in a trance) then at any time on their turn they can pull the plug and jack out, severing any connections. If they are instead in a trance, they have to get their conscious back to wherever they first entered from (physical jack, wifi, or public net). Assuming that path back is all along controlled systems they can act instantly. If it isn&rsquo;t they have to spend turns gain access to the nodes in the way. Alternatively while in a trance, they can just jack out, but suffer 2D10 non-lethal fatigue damage. Also if they are ever incapacitated while being in a trance, they will also jack out immediately without further consequences.</p>
<p>Each connection is either bi-directional, or controlling. If the connection is bi-directional, you can get from either node to the other, and controlling the node on one side, does not help you control the other. If the connection is controlling, they one system is able to send orders to the other, meaning that if you control that node, you also can give orders to the downstream node, or access it without a check.</p>
<p>Each node or hacker that you try to act on has a firewall rating, which is the target number for most hacking actions. There are then modifiers depending on how you are accessing the node which are applied to your roll. See the following tables.</p>

<p> Each node can potentially have defensive software loaded on it. This is split into software which will always go off when a hacker is either in the node, or enters it (rare), and software that starting triggering once the alarm goes off (common). Each piece of software is a power, from the hacker powers list. It is casted using the hack skill of the system, with normal modifiers from the difficulty, but no penalties from failing to cast. A node cannot be a wildcard. </P>
<p>Certain powers generate noise, representing small errors and issues that system security will eventually pick up on. Noise is associated with the network of connected nodes that powers were used in. So if you cause noise in a system connected to 10 other nodes, the noise builds up for all of them. At the start of each turn for each network, roll a D10, if the result is equal or less then the amount of noise currently in the network, add one noise. If at the start of a turn the amount of noise is now 10, the alarm goes off, alerting any whitehats on the system, and broader corporate security. Note that if you cut off a node from other nodes and split a network in half, both parts inherit 100% of the original noise, but noise is only generated after the power takes effect. So if I split the camera computer from the broader network, it would still stay at 2 noise, if that was the level at the start of the turn. But if cutting the system off generated 2 noise, the systems that were linked before the power would not gain any.</p>
<h2>Powers - Hacker</h2>
<p>If you are a Hacker, this section details what powers you can use.</p>
<p>Your Arcane Skill is Hacking (Smarts). You start with the Control System power, and two additional starting powers of your choice.</p>
<p>When you first use a power on a system you have to decide if you want to go into a trance while hacking. If you do not, you are just using a device screen, and have awareness of what is happening around you. If you go into a trance you are fully in the system, and cannot see or notice things happening around your body. Each turn you are in a trance, you either decide to go cool or hot. If you are running cool, you apply -5 to all noise generated by the power to a minimum of 0. If you are running hot, you take 4 separate actions a turn, drawing 4 separate cards if in combat.</p>
<p>When you use a power apply the modifier on the power to your roll. If you get a raise on the check, apply -5 to all noise generated by the power to a minimum of 0. If you get a critical failure, the alarm on the network immediately goes off.</p>

<h2>Powers - Super</h2>
<p>If you are a Super, this section details what you can do with Magic.</p>
<p>Your Arcane Skill is Flow (Spirit). You start with 1, 5 point stance.</p>
<p>Unlike other casters, all of your powers manifest in your body, requiring far more thought and training to adapt your form to them, and stop them from conflicting. All of your powers exclusively either impact yourself, or have a touch range.</p>
<p>Instead of taking individual powers, you take combinations of powers called stances. For each stance select up to X power points of different powers. To activate a stance make a Flow (Spirit) roll, on a sucsess or fail they go into effect, but on a fail take one point of faitigue. On a critical fail take a point of faitigue and the stance does not work. On a raise, treat each component power as having gotten a raise.</p>
<p>You can only have one stance active at a time. Once a stance is active it will stay active until the user turns it off, the Super is no longer conscious/awake, or something breaks their concentration. At the start of a Supers turn, if they were shaken or stunned in the previous round they must pass a Flow (Spirit) test to keep control, otherwise their stance ends. Otherwise if an event occurs that would cause them to lose concentration the GM can require a new check.</p> 
<p> The tn for any Flow (Spirit) roll related to a stance is the power points used in the stance.</p>
<p>The following Powers are available, with several restrictions. The main one being modifiers cannot be applied unless noted on the list bellow. Also use the PP costs noted in paranthases.</p>

<h2>Powers - Summoner</h2>
<p>If you are a Summoner, this section details what you can do with Magic.</p>
<p>Your Arcane Skill is Summoning (Spirit). You start with 3 starting powers and 10 power points. </p>
<p>Every spell that you cast has the effect &lsquo;PERMANENT&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>PERMANENT:</strong> Any creature summoned or controlled, will remain under your control until the creature is either incapacitated, or you decide to relinquish control. The power points used to summon/control it are &ldquo;invested&rdquo; and unavailable until you no longer control it. Once you no longer control it your power points begin to recharge normally.</p>
<p>Casting spells does not require a roll, unless otherwise noted. However to give orders to anything you control requires a Summoning (Spirit) roll with a TN equal to the power points invested in that entity. On a success they carry out the orders to the best of their ability. On a fail they carry out the orders to the best of their understanding.</p>
<p>The following are the spells available to be taken:</p>
<h3>Control Dead</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: 2 + 1/Zombie, Range: Spirit</p>
<p>Control dead grants animation and basic intelligence to the remains of a once-living being. The summoned horror is obedient but literal minded in its duties. It is controlled telepathically over any range.</p>
<p>Corpses aren&rsquo;t summoned by this ability, so there must actually be a supply of bodies in Range. The brain must be intact. An undead Incapacitated by damage can&rsquo;t be raised with this power again. Raising non-human targets does not work, outside of a few edge cases (African Greys, Corvids, Great Apes), where you can give very limited orders. </p>
<p>They have the following Stat Block:</p>
<p>Attributes: Agility/Strength/Vigor: Same as living - defaults to d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4<br>
Skills: All D4<br>
Pace: 4; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7,<br>
Special Abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bite/Claws: Str</li>
<li>Fearless: Zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation.</li>
<li>Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from Called Shots; ignores 1 point of Wound penalties; doesn&rsquo;t breathe; immune to disease and poison.</li>
<li>Weakness (Head): Called Shots to a zombie&rsquo;s head do the usual +4 damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dominate Animal</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: SIZE of each creature controlled (min 1), Range: Spirit<br /></p>
<p>This grants you the ability to take control of an animal. Attempts to control humans will fail since their minds are to complex. Once controlled you can give commands telepathically from any distance.</p>
<p>The SIZE of an animal is defined in the rules but for reference a wolf is -1, a Human is 0, a Lion is 1, and a Horse is 2. Also you can control swarms with small swarms being 1, medium swarms being 2, large swarms being 3.</p>
<p>You can control any creature with an animal smarts attribute (noted with &lsquo;(A)&rsquo;). If the creature has smarts of d4 or d6 resolve as noted above. If you try to control animals with near human intelligence (African Greys, Corvids, Great Apes), creature&apos;s with smarts of d8 or higher, on casting you need to pass a Summoning (Spirit) check against a TN equal to 1 + half their smarts (5-7) to take control. This TN is also the number of Power Points used, and the difficulty to give them orders. While not technically illegal doing this to a creature with near human intelligence will break their mind, in line with Humans. </p>
<p>The stats of creatures can be found in the rules, or extrapolated from those listings. </p>
<h3>Summon Spirit</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: Varies, Range: Spirit<br /></p>
<p>This power allows you to summon forth a spirit of magical energy under your command. They often take the form of figures from mythology, but can also resemble animals or pure elements, depending on the nature of the summoner</p>
<p>You can take this power multiple times. Each time you take this power define a spirit using the following rules, from that point on that is the only spirit that can be summoned with that version of the power.</p>
<p>Every spirit starts with a d4 in each attribute, a pace of 4, no skills and the SPIRIT ability:</p>
<p><strong>SPIRIT:</strong> This creature is immune to called shots, fear, fatigue, disease, poison, does not need to eat or breath, counts all attacks as magical, and is considered extraplaner for the purposes of powers and abilities<br /></p>
<p>To build a spirit, first you need to determine the strength of the spirit being summoned. See the following table for rank requirements and costs:<br /></p>

<p>Now that you have defined the power point cost of the spirit you can spend the build points to upgrade them. The only upgrade that is mandatory is picking a size for them from the next table. Beyond that you can select stat upgrades from the table after that, or unqiue abilities from the final list. All the items in the second table can be taken multiple times, unless otherwise noted.<br /></p>
