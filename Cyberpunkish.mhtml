<h1>Background</h1>=20
<h2>Guide to Seattle</h2>=20
<p><em>Excerpted from "The Fire and the Future, Seattle in the 90s,and the =
decade that changed the world"</em></p>=20
<h3>1994 Cadabra is Born</h3>=20
<p>The second newest of the big four tech firms in Seattle, this retail gia=
nt was founded by Jeff &amp; MacKenzie in 1994. While their original plan m=
ay have been to sell books, they would quickly seize on the wave of awakeni=
ng in their backyard to propel their firm to the behemoth which runs half t=
he worlds websites, and delivers more packages then the USPS, DHL, and UPS =
combined. </p>=20
<h3>1995 IONS founded</h3>=20
<p>The most recent, and possibly most influential of the big four, IONS was=
 formally incorporated in 1995. It inherited the patents and groundbreaking=
 work of Michael Bertiaux and Howard Rheingold, which would form the basis =
of both the awakening, magic, and modern cybernetics today. CEO Willis Harm=
an then took the bold step of combining all of these patents into a single =
unified pool, with a fixed fee, open to anyone who wished to utilize the te=
chnology, setting the groundwork for the company=92s future wealth, and mak=
ing it into the R&amp;D giant that continues to be integral to most advance=
ments in technology today.</p>=20
<h3>1996 The Father of All Demos</h3>=20
<p>While the patents were filed and theoretically open to all a year earlie=
r, it was this presentation to a UW auditorium in July of 1996 which would =
set off the boom that subsequently consumed the world. Over the course of a=
n hour Willis Harman demonstrated both the finished Obsidian and Ruby impla=
nts, giving birth to the modern mages and hackers respectively, along with =
the first practical examples of cybernetic enhancement. While the broader p=
ublic would remain skeptical of both the truth and usefulness of these disc=
overies for years to come, the local business community was sold, kicking o=
ff the first boom. </p>=20
<h3>1999 United States v. Microsoft Corp.</h3>=20
<p>While the case itself was quickly overshadowed by Black December, the di=
vision of Microsoft would have massive implications for the local economy, =
and create the big four as we know them today. No longer shackled by having=
 to promote an operating system, the new Microsoft would rapidly expand int=
o new areas of growth, launching new ERP, finance, and multimedia software,=
 and becoming the omnipresent element of all of our lives. And Windows Corp=
, now left with one major stream of revenue, found itself forced to both ex=
pand its offerings for operating environments both larger servers, smaller =
mobile devices, and all manner of integrated applications in-between. Not t=
o mention the launch of their Portal cloud environments, making them integr=
al to the modern internet.</p>=20
<h3>1999 1/12 (Battle for Seattle)</h3>=20
<p>The WTO meetings in Seattle were contentious from the start. Even before=
 1/12 there was demonstrating, rioting, and pitched battles with police all=
 around the sites of the meetings. It was becoming increasing clear that th=
e police were losing control of the situation when Bill Clinton made the fa=
teful decision to attend the sessions on 1/12 in person. As the president e=
xited his convoy to a crowd of the worlds press, no one was expecting a man=
 to suddenly appear behind him holding a sword, let alone for that man to d=
ecapitate the sitting president and disappear just as suddenly. </p>=20
<p>It would take nearly a weak before it was clear that the anarchist and b=
lack block groups organizing the demonstrations were not responsible, but i=
nstead the awakened terrorists of the Invisible Committee. But in that time=
 the reaction was swift and harsh, with thousands being held without trial,=
 and nearly 10 blocks of downtown being heavily damaged or abandoned in the=
 ensuing clean up operations.<br></p>=20
<h3>1999 YTK</h3>=20
<p>The city was still in the early stages of recovery from the battle of Se=
attle, when the final chapter of Black December came to a close. In a matte=
r of minutes more then half the computers in the city were no longer operat=
ing, and 73% of the city found itself without power for nearly three days. =
While this further delayed the attempts to rebuild the city, more immediate=
ly this served as the final catalyst for President Gore to declare the war =
on terror, plunging the USA and Seattle into the 21st century. </p>=20
<h2>The Game</h2>=20
<p><em>Archived from the 3chan general interest board on July 25th, 2024</e=
m></p>=20
<p><em>Posted [2024:07:24:21:34:12]</em></p>=20
<p>Screw it, storytime. I am so tired of all these terrible threads talking=
 about deniable assets, and the jobs that they pull, which are 90% lies, an=
d 10% shit you looked up on backrub, which are also lies. So now that I am =
out of the game, lets set the record straight about how real operators cond=
uct business. </p>=20
<p><em>Posted [2024:07:24:21:37:36] </em></p>=20
<p>So first you need a brief history lesson, my old profession did not real=
ly start with the awakening, or with the internet, or with cybernetics, or =
any other discovery. No those all played in to it, but my profession starte=
d on January 4th, 2000 when President Gore signed the SECURITY act. That bi=
ll required anyone who was awakened to register with the federal government=
, and provide regular updates on their location and employment. Which split=
 the burgeoning community of more abled into two camps, those the governmen=
t knew about, and those they did not. That second group suddenly found itse=
lf without legitimate means of employment, but with a suddenly enhanced mar=
ket position for committing crimes. No longer could a hacker decide to just=
 liberate a savings and loans institution of its surplus currency on a whim=
, if you were on the books they would find you, and if you weren=92t you be=
tter get good at it, since it is now your job.</p>=20
<p>And hire us they did, because in a world where only one in 50,000 has th=
e talent to begin with, its a lot easier to go on the offense and hire a he=
avy for a day, then to hire a straight for 10 years on the off chance your =
attacked.</p>=20
<p>Posted [2024:07:24:21:40:02]<br></p>=20
<p>So if you are a young person, with a lack of documentation, flexible mor=
als, and a Jordan Belfort esc desire to get rich, how do you start. Well fi=
rst you need a crew. One person working on their own is very unlikely to to=
 able to accomplish much beyond serving as target practice. Then you need t=
o find a fixer. This is the disreputable individual who will put you in con=
tact with you=92re employer. Said employer will then give you a job, and a =
you can either take it, not take it, or try and haggle them up on the price=
. And I recommend going hard on the second and third of those, there is not=
hing forcing you to take a job, and there is nothing forcing you to take a =
job at a bad price. </p>=20
<p>Posted [2024:07:24:21:43:56]<br></p>=20
<blockquote>Being aggressive with an employer seems like a great way to nev=
er get work again.</blockquote>=20
<p>Ya this is what I was talking about before, this movie crap. It is the e=
mployers literal job to haggle, and deal with the disappointment of teams b=
acking out on them. If they reacted to normal everyday business as a person=
al slight they will be out of a job in 6 months. Also while we are at it, i=
t is also not crucial that you are in the dark on the real entity that is p=
laying for your services. The crucial part is that no one can prove the com=
pany paid you, you figuring out who the company is, is irrelevant, and if y=
our employer is going to a lot of lengths to hide that, its a massive red f=
lag.</p>=20
<p>Which brings us to the final part of this, actually carrying out the job=
. First you need to plan heavily for how you are going to pull this off. Yo=
u advantage as the attacker is that your opponents don=92t know when and wh=
ere you are striking, so maximize that and figure out ahead of time where a=
nd when to go in. This isn=92t a fucking movie, people who go in and wing i=
t end up in jail, or dead, or dead in jail. </p>=20
<p>On a related note, shooting people like your Hans Gruber is also a terri=
ble idea. This isn=92t some 80s action vehicle, if you shoot someone in the=
 face that is murder. So unless for some terrible reason you have decided t=
o go after some third world military, or attack an Oracle Zero Zone, stick =
to the non-lethal options if you don=92t want all the 3 letter agencies try=
ing to give you a field colonoscopy.<br></p>=20
<p>Then once you have done the thing, you get to go back to get your money.=
 No there is this weird idea that this is when your employer is going to tr=
y and stiff you, which is insane. If they do that word will get out, and th=
ey will not be hiring anyone again. If they are going to fuck you over, the=
y are going to do it during the job. That said, best practice is to hold on=
to the item until the cash clears.</p>=20
<h2>Magic</h2>=20
<p><em>Willis Harman=92s Testimony to the Rehnquist Commission</em><br></p>=
=20
<p>What is magic? There are several things that this commission has asked m=
e to explain or illuminate today in the light of recent tragic events but t=
his seems to be the most fundamental. So what is magic? I could claim that =
its life, that its power, that its will and all of that is true, but as in =
many things my now deceased friend and colleague Michael Bertiaux put it be=
st with his 11 Commandments:</p>=20
<ol>=20
<li>Magic Comes from Focused Will</li>=20
<li>Magic is Fueled from Life</li>=20
<li>Magic Takes Effort equal to its effect by the efficiency to the 8th pow=
er</li>=20
<li>Magic Cannot Create more Life</li>=20
<li>Magic Cannot Create a Soul</li>=20
<li>Magic Cannot Manipulate Time</li>=20
<li>Magic Cannot Remove Matter from Reality</li>=20
<li>The Soul is Inherent to it=92s form, to Change it is to Destroy it</li>=
=20
<li>To Observe Something is to Change it</li>=20
<li>A Soul Once Destroyed Cannot be Restored</li>=20
<li>To Destroy the Soul is to Kill</li>=20
</ol>=20
<p>Any question you have is answered there. Can you bring back the dead? No=
, nor can you speak or commune with them. Can you go back in time? No, with=
 all respect to Marty McFly it=92s functionally impossible, as is going for=
ward or sideways, and attempts at prophesy or fortune telling also fail. Wh=
at about teleportation? Well our friends at the postal service can rest eas=
y because that to is beyond our keen. Well surely you say we can enchant an=
 object, a sword or a mirror, or even just a broom? Alas no object has a mi=
nd of it=92s own and without a mind to hold it the power just seeps away. A=
nd any attempt to ape Dr Frankenstein and make a golem, or to control other=
s minds, or any other trick best seen in a Hammer Horror Film also do not w=
ork. Even attempts to directly heal the sick often are not possible. The bo=
dy is a powerful thing, and while you can often restore something damaged, =
your body may well see Leukemia as working as intended. </p>=20
<p>Apart from those rules though, well you can do anything, if you have a d=
iscipline and the power. Move at impossible speeds, lift impossible objects=
, summon spirits to assist you, even Fly. Just don=92t ask me to read your =
mind. </p>=20
<h1>Savage Worlds Ruleset</h1>=20
<p>This is the demo ruleset for running this setting in savage worlds.</p>=
=20
<h2>Races</h2>=20
<p>The races in this setting represent which of the awakened options your c=
haracter has taken. Options are Hacker, Driver, Heavy, Mage, Summoner, Supe=
r, Regular.</p>=20
<h3>Hacker</h3>=20
<p><em>Where most people see the internet through screens and machines, you=
 see the internet by jacking in, or for the newer kids getting close enough=
 to a WIFI spot.</em></p>=20
<p>You are able to take the Hacking (Smarts) Skill. </p>=20
<p>You can take Hacker Edges</p>=20
<p>You have a derived stat 'Firewall', equal to 2 + Hacking/2</p>
<h3>Driver</h3>=20
<p><em>The average person these days relies on their car to drive itself, w=
here you tell 20 cars where to drive themselves. Not only can you control m=
ultiple devices at the same time, you can also jump into a specific device =
and pilot it like you were there, useful assuming your smarter then whateve=
r the lowest bidder wrote for the AI.</em></p>=20
<p>The total number of cars/drones/boats/devices you can control is theoret=
ically unlimited, but you can only give direction to a number of groups equ=
al to half your smarts die (so d6 is 3 groups)</p>=20
<p>You can also at any point jump into a specific device, in which case you=
 may now roll and take all checks for the vehicle using your own stats and =
wild die, at plus 1. </p>=20
<p>You can take Driver Edges</p>=20
<h3>Heavy</h3>=20
<p><em>Thanks to your awakening, your understanding of your own body has ne=
ver been greater. When normal men cannot handle cybernetics which boost pas=
t normal human potential you are able to use them without any issues.</em><=
/p>=20
<p>In combat deal two initiative cards to the Heavy, they act on both of th=
em taking full turns.</p>=20
<p>Outside of combat, all tasks and movement take half as much time.</p>=20
<p>You can take Heavy Edges</p>=20
<h3>Mage</h3>=20
<p><em>Your a Wizard Harry=85 Ya wont be the first or last time you hear th=
at, but being able to bend spacetime over your knee and make it cry uncle i=

<p>You are able to take the Spellcasting (Smarts) Skill.<em><br></em></p>=
=20
<p>You can take Mage Edges</p>=20
<h3>Summoner</h3>=20
<p><em>You feel like your people have gotten a bad rap. The ability to summ=
on and control creatures from beyond mortal keen has many uses, and the fac=
t that every representation in the media is necromancer this, warlock that =
is hurtful. Sometimes you also bring out old ones.</em></p>=20
<p>You are able to take the Summoning (Spirit) Skill.<em><br></em></p>=20
<p>You can take Summoner Edges</p>=20
<h3>Super</h3>=20
<p><em>Have you ever wanted to stop bullets with your hand, fold into a sui=
tcase, jump up 10 stories, make yourself invisible? Well all of those and m=
ore are possible if you can find your connection to the flow, and manifest =
it through your body. Just don=92t try all four of those at once, we are st=
ill cleaning up bits of Fred.</em></p>=20
<p>You are able to take the Flow (Spirit) Skill.<em><br></em></p>=20
<p>You can take Super Edges</p>=20
<h3>Regular</h3>=20
<p><em>You are just a normal person, no awakened powers. That said, no norm=
al person would survive in this business, so you clearly have some incredib=
le talents under the surface, that just required less invasive surgery.</em=

<h2>Gear</h2>
<p>We are not tracking money in this game. Instead of purchasing a fixed am=
ount of gear, you can take anything that it reasonable for your character s=
ubject to the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should fit what your characters background and role is (a summoner p=
robably would not have a mil-spec rifle)</li>
<li>Common gear, Modern Melee Weapons, Modern Ranged Weapons, Modern Firear=
ms excluding lasers, flamethrowers, grenades, mines, missiles, rocket launc=
hers, non-futuristic vehicular weapons, and any civilian vehicle are all in=
</li>
<li>Military vehicles, and the pilot vehicles noted below are only availabl=
e to pilots by taking edges</li>
<li>Armor is limited to the listing below</li>
<li>There are other alternative ammo types and items below<br></li>
<li>Please retheme any of these items to better fit the setting, but the me=
chanics of an assault rifle have not changed much</li>
</ul>
<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>The following items are available to players:</p>
<p>Bullet Resistant Clothing (Armor: 0, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5, Special: +=
2 armor against bullets, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabric garme=
nt)</p>
<p>Stab Resistant Clothing (Armor: 0, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5, Special: +2 =
armor stab and slashing attacks, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabr=
ic garment)<br></p>
<p>Light Combat Armor (Armor: 2, Min Str.: d6, weight: 12, Special: +2 armo=
r against bullets, Note: can take form of vest, or other fabric garment)</p=
>
<p>Heavy Combat Armor (Armor: 4, Min Str.: d8, weight: 25, Special: +2 armo=
r against bullets)</p>
<p>Riot Shield (Parry: +3, Cover: -4, Min Str.: d4, weight: 5) </p>
<p>Riot Shield (Parry: +3, Cover: -4, Min Str.: d6, weight: 9, Special: +4 =
to armor if the attack is a bullet, and it goes through the riot shield)<br=
></p>
<h3>Other Items</h3>
<p>Rhino Rounds (These pressurized rounds go off with concussive force when=
 they make contact with the opponent, knocking them off their feet. Can be =
fired from modern firearms, the weapon loses all AP, non-lethal, if an atta=
ck would normally wound a target (second shaken or with a raise) stun them =
instead)</p>
<p>Lightning Rounds (These gel filled rounds carry a strong electric charge=
, immobilizing opposing targets. Can be fired from modern firearms, the wea=
pon loses all AP, but now deals non-lethal damage, which goes against the f=
atigue track)</p>
<h2>Driver Vehicles</h2>
<p>This section outlines the drones and other vehicles available to Drivers=
. Unlike normal vehicles which come basically unmodified from large manufac=
turers, drivers take basic vehicle models and extensively customize them. N=
ote that the base options are split into drones, and vehicles. Vehicles fol=
low the normal rules from the core book, drones are instead created like hu=
man extras.</p>
<p>All of these craft have several ratings. First there is handling, which =
is a flat bonus to any rolls to maneuver the craft in question. Second ther=
e is AI, which is the die type used on any checks from the craft. Third is =
wounds, which overrides the normal rules for extras going out in one hit. F=
ourth is capacity, which indicates how many capacity points of gear can be =
attached to the craft from the subsequent chart. Fifth is category, which s=
ets out what groups of equipment are available to each vehicle.</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2>=20
<p>This section outlines how hacking works in this setting. This primarily =
impacts characters playing hackers, but has implications for the general wa=
y computer networks work.</p>
<p>Each computer, camera, server, device is a 'node'. If you control the no=
de then you have access to all the data on it, and can give commands to it,=
 and anything controlled by it. Each node has a number of 'connections' whi=
ch link it to other nodes and the outside world. For example if you have a =
machine that controls security cameras, it might have a physical port that =
is a connection, a line connection to the server in the building, and a con=
nection to the public internet. All abilities or attempts to influence a ma=
chine require you to use one of these connections. If it is physical, you n=
eed to be plugged in, or in wifi range, if it is to the net you need to hav=
e access to the internet, and if it is to another system, you need to eithe=
r control or occupy that system. A hacker is in the most recent system they=
 have operated on, without jacking out.</p>
<p>A hacker is in the most recent system they have operated on, without jac=
king out. So if I just hacked the camera computer, that is the system I am =
in. A hacker on their action can move between any controlled connected node=
s freely before taking an action. If the hacker is acting normally (not in =
a trance) then at any time on their turn they can pull the plug and jack ou=
t, severing any connections. If they are instead in a trance, they have to =
get their conscious back to wherever they first entered from (physical jack=
, wifi, or public net). Assuming that path back is all along controlled sys=
tems they can act instantly. If it isn=92t they have to spend turns gain ac=
cess to the nodes in the way. Alternatively while in a trance, they can jus=
t jack out, but suffer 2D10 non-lethal fatigue damage. Also if they are eve=
r incapacitated while being in a trance, they will also jack out immediatel=
y without further consequences.</p>
<p>Each connection is either bi-directional, or controlling. If the connect=
ion is bi-directional, you can get from either node to the other, and contr=
olling the node on one side, does not help you control the other. If the co=
nnection is controlling, they one system is able to send orders to the othe=
r, meaning that if you control that node, you also can give orders to the d=
ownstream node, or access it without a check.</p>
<p>Each node or hacker that you try to act on has a firewall rating, which =
is the target number for most hacking actions. There are then modifiers dep=
ending on how you are accessing the node which are applied to your roll. Se=
e the following tables.</p>

<p> Each node can potentially have defensive software loaded on it. This is=
 split into software which will always go off when a hacker is either in th=
e node, or enters it (rare), and software that starting triggering once the=
 alarm goes off (common). Each piece of software is a power, from the hacke=
r powers list. It is casted using the hack skill of the system, with normal=
 modifiers from the difficulty, but no penalties from failing to cast. A no=
de cannot be a wildcard. </p>
<p>Certain powers generate noise, representing small errors and issues that=
 system security will eventually pick up on. Noise is associated with the n=
etwork of connected nodes that powers were used in. So if you cause noise i=
n a system connected to 10 other nodes, the noise builds up for all of them=
. At the start of each turn for each network, roll a D10, if the result is =
equal or less then the amount of noise currently in the network, add one no=
ise. If at the start of a turn the amount of noise is now 10, the alarm goe=
s off, alerting any whitehats on the system, and broader corporate security=
. Note that if you cut off a node from other nodes and split a network in h=
alf, both parts inherit 100% of the original noise, but noise is only gener=
ated after the power takes effect. So if I split the camera computer from t=
he broader network, it would still stay at 2 noise, if that was the level a=
t the start of the turn. But if cutting the system off generated 2 noise, t=
he systems that were linked before the power would not gain any.</p>
<h2>Powers - Hacker</h2>
<p>If you are a Hacker, this section details what powers you can use.</p>
<p>Your Arcane Skill is Hacking (Smarts). You start with the Control System=
 power, and two additional starting powers of your choice.</p>
<p>When you first use a power on a system you have to decide if you want to=
 go into a trance while hacking. If you do not, you are just using a device=
 screen, and have awareness of what is happening around you. If you go into=
 a trance you are fully in the system, and cannot see or notice things happ=
ening around your body. Each turn you are in a trance, you either decide to=
 go cool or hot. If you are running cool, you apply -5 to all noise generat=
ed by the power to a minimum of 0. If you are running hot, you take 4 separ=
ate actions a turn, drawing 4 separate cards if in combat.</p>
<p>When you use a power apply the modifier on the power to your roll. If yo=
u get a raise on the check, apply -5 to all noise generated by the power to=
 a minimum of 0. If you get a critical failure, the alarm on the network im=
mediately goes off.</p>

<h2>Powers - Summoner</h2>
<p>If you are a Summoner, this section details what you can do with Magic.<=
/p>
<p>Your Arcane Skill is Summoning (Spirit). You start with 3 starting power=
s and 10 power points. </p>
<p>Every spell that you cast has the effect =91PERMANENT=92.</p>
<p><strong>PERMANENT:</strong> Any creature summoned or controlled, will re=
main under your control until the creature is either incapacitated, or you =
decide to relinquish control. The power points used to summon/control it ar=
e =93invested=94 and unavailable until you no longer control it. Once you n=
o longer control it your power points begin to recharge normally.</p>
<p>Casting spells does not require a roll, unless otherwise noted. However =
to give orders to anything you control requires a Summoning (Spirit) roll w=
ith a TN equal to the power points invested in that entity. On a success th=
ey carry out the orders to the best of their ability. On a fail they carry =
out the orders to the best of their understanding.</p>
<p>The following are the spells available to be taken:</p>
<h3>Control Dead</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: 2 + 1/Zombie, Range: Spirit</p>
<p>Control dead grants animation and basic intelligence to the remains of a=
 once-living being. The summoned horror is obedient but literal minded in i=
ts duties. It is controlled telepathically over any range.</p>
<p>Corpses aren=92t summoned by this ability, so there must actually be a s=
upply of bodies in Range. The brain must be intact. An undead Incapacitated=
 by damage can=92t be raised with this power again. Raising non-human targe=
ts does not work, outside of a few edge cases (African Greys, Corvids, Grea=
t Apes), where you can give very limited orders. </p>
<p>They have the following Stat Block:</p>
<p>Attributes: Agility/Strength/Vigor: Same as living - defaults to d6, Sma=

<h3>Dominate Animal</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: SIZE of each creature controlled (min 1), Ra=
nge: Spirit<br></p>
<p>This grants you the ability to take control of an animal. Attempts to co=
ntrol humans will fail since their minds are to complex. Once controlled yo=
u can give commands telepathically from any distance.</p>
<p>The SIZE of an animal is defined in the rules but for reference a wolf i=
s -1, a Human is 0, a Lion is 1, and a Horse is 2. Also you can control swa=
rms with small swarms being 1, medium swarms being 2, large swarms being 3.=
</p>
<p>You can control any creature with an animal smarts attribute (noted with=
 =91(A)=92). If the creature has smarts of d4 or d6 resolve as noted above.=
 If you try to control animals with near human intelligence (African Greys,=
 Corvids, Great Apes), creature's with smarts of d8 or higher, on casting y=
ou need to pass a Summoning (Spirit) check against a TN equal to 1 + half t=
heir smarts (5-7) to take control. This TN is also the number of Power Poin=
ts used, and the difficulty to give them orders. While not technically ille=
gal doing this to a creature with near human intelligence will break their =
mind, in line with Humans. </p>
<p>The stats of creatures can be found in the rules, or extrapolated from t=
hose listings. </p>
<h3>Summon Spirit</h3>
<p>Rank: Novice, Power Points: Varies, Range: Spirit<br></p>
<p>This power allows you to summon forth a spirit of magical energy under y=
our command. They often take the form of figures from mythology, but can al=
so resemble animals or pure elements, depending on the nature of the summon=
er</p>
<p>You can take this power multiple times. Each time you take this power de=
fine a spirit using the following rules, from that point on that is the onl=
y spirit that can be summoned with that version of the power.</p>
<p>Every spirit starts with a d4 in each attribute, a pace of 4, no skills =
and the SPIRIT ability:</p>
<p><strong>SPIRIT:</strong> This creature is immune to called shots, fear, =
fatigue, disease, poison, does not need to eat or breath, counts all attack=
s as magical, and is considered extraplaner for the purposes of powers and =
abilities<br></p>
<p>To build a spirit, first you need to determine the strength of the spiri=
t being summoned. See the following table for rank requirements and costs:<=
br></p>

<p>Now that you have defined the power point cost of the spirit you can spe=
nd the build points to upgrade them. The only upgrade that is mandatory is =
picking a size for them from the next table. Beyond that you can select sta=
t upgrades from the table after that, or unqiue abilities from the final li=
st. All the items in the second table can be taken multiple times, unless o=
therwise noted.<br></p>
