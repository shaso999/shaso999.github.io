<h1 id="Affordable">On Affordable Housing (or why the rent is too damn high)</h1>
<p>Prices to rent and buy housing are too high in most NA markets (Sorry Winnipeg) because there is a massive shortage of supply.</p>
<p>Put simply there are more people that want to live in NYC, than there are places to sleep. So like in any case where at a given price point more people want a thing than want to sell a thing, the price goes up until Supply equals demand. In this case until the price is high enough that the number of people who want to live in a studio apartment in Queens equal the number of dilapidated rooms ($3500/month not including utilities).</p>
<p>So if you want to fix this problem you need more places for people to sleep. There is no other solution. There is no way to magic your way out of this problem, because the basic issue is you are trying to fit 100 people into 80 beds, and you need some mechanism to decide which 20 people have to sleep in New Jersey instead.</p>
<p>The other part of this is that it doesn’t matter what sort of housing you build you just need more of it. There is no such thing as a luxury apartment or a low income apartment, because people have to sleep somewhere, and will find the best thing in their budget. If the only options for someone who wants to live in SoHo are $4,500 a month, even if that place has literal holes in the walls they will take it, since it's in the spot they want to live, and they don’t have other choices. Vice versa if all an owner can get for a “luxury unit” is $600 a month due to an overbuild, they will rent it out at that price since it's better than it being empty.</p>
<p>So even if you're just adding new “Luxury Units” it still helps since the people who moved into that unit, were living somewhere else before, which can now be rented. There is only one housing market.</p>
<p>This also goes for homes and condos. If there are more people who want to live in a place than homes, prices will go up. The “quality” of the homes does not matter (See Vancouver), people will just buy crappier homes if that is the only option at their price point.</p>
<p>TLDR There is only one housing market, to bring down prices, build more places for people to sleep regardless of its price point or nature.</p>

<h1 id="Rent">On Rent Control</h1>
<p>Rent control is the single most destructive economic policy that is Western governments enforce, coming right in front of green belts.</p>
<p>When you put a ceiling on rent several things happen.</p>
<p><b>First</b>, people stop building rental units, since they can no longer get a market return on their investment. Instead the units get turned into Condos or homes, since you can now make more that way with the same amounts of land. This also causes people to convert their current rental stock into condos.</p>
<p><b>Second</b>, because there are now fewer rental units then people willing to rent them, you get rationing. It is now hard to find an apartment at all, since there are multiple potential residents for each unit. See NYC if you want an example of this.</p>
<p><b>Third</b>, because of the first two points the quality of rental units goes down hill. Owners no longer have to care about treating tenets well, since it is easy for them to refill the units at the specified price. As such the units start to physically deteriorate, and tenant concerns are basically ignored.</p>
<p><b>Fourth</b>, you now make it very hard for people to move into the city or between parts of the city hurting the economy further. Given that there are not enough units for everyone, and the quality is low, people do not want to give up units they have, people just move less.</p>
<p><b>Fifth</b>, given the quality of the units and all of these other issues people are forced into purchasing homes instead. This further hampers their mobility, and locks up massive amounts of capital in real estate.</p>
<p><b>Sixth, NONE OF THIS HELPS THE POOR.</b> In a world with rent control, the people that get the units are the people who can work the system. The people who can work the system the best, spending time to find the few available units are middle class people and up. Beyond that people renting out units will all else being equal prefer the better off tenants who are less likely to run into issues paying the even reduced rent.</p>
<p>So ya this is a policy that hurts everyone, but we get to live with it, because it's apparently impossible for any competent municipal politician to explain this to voters.</p>

<h1 id="Cashflow">Cashflow 101</h1>
<p>The cash-flow statement is just the income statement for cash. The income statement summarizes the changes in equity, how you got from Opening retained earnings to Closing retained earnings. The Cashflow statement is exactly the same but looking at cash instead. So treat Cash like it is equity, it is the remainder of your balance sheet once all the other components have been accounted for.</p> 
<p>So the change in cash will be equal to the net change in all your other balance sheet items. In the case of equity increases in Assets increase it and increases in liabilities decrease it, since it is on the liability side of the balance sheet (or a negative number). With cash it is reversed, since it is sitting on the Asset side of the balance sheet (a positive number). So all else being equal if your assets are higher, your cash has to be lower, and if the Liability side of the sheet expands, you cash must be getting bigger. So for example if your cash went up by $5MM, then your liabilities + equity - non-cash assets has to also be up by $5MM.</p> 
<p>The other question if how you eliminate non-cash transactions, since the balance sheet includes both real cash transactions, and non-cash accruals or provisions. The key thing to remember is that thanks to double entry accounting, every non-cash transaction has two sides that cancel out. So as long as you exclude both sides your cash-flow will still balance. To use the PPE example, if you are amortizing a car, that is a debit to equity and a credit to fixed asset, so as long as you back both sides out of your calc, you still get to the correct amount of cash.</p>
