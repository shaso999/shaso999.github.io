<h1 id="Background">Background</h1>
<p>The purpose of this system is to have a bare-bones RPG that can be used to either a&#41; spin up a game quickly, or b&#41; serve as the foundation for a more built out game on top of it. I will leave notes inline as I go, but there are two things it is trying to solve. One is downtime at the table, every minute someone is looking up a rule, or more often consulting their sheet to see what skills even exist that may cover this scenario, is time that the game grinds to a halt. So it is built from the ground up to be a system where all the reference materials for running it fit on a page, and the players need a playing card at most. Second this system is designed to serve as the base resolution layer for any type of RPG on top, and as such has no dedicated combat rules in it. If you want to run a big shooting game, then that probably makes sense as something to bolt on, but there are lots of options for mechanics in games that are not "shoot the man" or more recently "track my social bonds with the man". So if you were trying to get your 'Drive to Survive' game, or 'Stardew Valley' knock off going, this is the place.</p> 
<h1 id="Character_Creation">Character Creation</h1>
<p>To start with, you need to understand the world this is taking place in, and what your place in that world would be. So the GM needs to tell you what the background is, for you to start with character creation.</p>
<h2 id="Character_Background">Character Background</h2>
<p>Fill in the following &#40;not necessarily in order&#41;</p>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>What is your characters name?</p>
<h3>Vital Statistics</h3>
<aside>
<p>To avoid a lot of trouble down the road, elfs & dwarfs & humans are all different species, not races. "Races" are about cultural background, societal perception, and visual differentiation, they do not mark meaningful biological differences. Good rule of thumb, is will you get fertile offspring crossing the two groups, if not you have species not races.</p>
</aside>
<p>Height, Weight, Sex, Race, Species, Religion, Caste, Scars, Tattoos, Hair/Eye colour, etc. These will differ in importance based on the campaign, but at least in broad terms you should put down how someone in this world would tell you apart visually from someone else based your appearance, and any immutable physiological facts about you. So saying tall or overweight is fine, but if elfs and gnomes are literal separate specifies in your world, you should mark which. Adding a picture also helps a lot.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Put down a few sentences of how you got to the point in time you are starting the campaign. Like a sentence for birth through adolescence, another through end of education, and whatever you need to cover what came after that. It does not need to be extensive, but should cover off who your character is.</p>
<blockquote>Austin was born in Western Canada to two English speaking science profs, and raised in a few different cities across the Canadian prairies as his family found better roles in different universities. Graduated from a public high school in Saskatoon, having focused mostly on theatre & academics, and ended up with a MEng then MBA from UBC. Currently lives in Seattle with his girlfriend Jullie, working at Microsoft, and enjoys amateur dramatics in his spare time.</blockquote> 
<h3>Job</h3>
<p>What is your characters job, the thing they get paid for and are good at? Should be 1-3 words, like 'accountant' or 'police sergeant' or 'mercenary'. </p>
<h2 id="Mechanics">Mechanics</h2>
<p>Next you need to choose your characters mechanical elements.</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>First you need to set your characters attributes, they are used for resolving actions and checks during the game. Your character has seven attributes that all start at <b>1</b>. You have <b>15</b> points to increase them, costing <b>one</b> point to raise any attribute by <b>one</b>, and you cannot increase an attribute over <b>five</b>.</p>
<p>The "Average" attribute is 3, increasing and decreasing in standard deviations. So 2 is bad, 1 is terrible, 4 is good, 5 is incredible.</p>
<img src="AttributeCurve.PNG"
     style="object-fit:contain;
            width:800px;
            height:auto"/>
<p>The seven attributes are as follows:</p>
<table class="c">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
	<th>ABRV</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brawn</td>
	<td>BRN</td>
    <td>How large, strong, and tough you are. Used for lifting, pulling, breaking, and dealing with the consequences of physical harm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Athletics</td>
	<td>ATH</td>
    <td>Represents how in shape and athletically capable you are. Used for running, swimming, jumping, swinging, and things relating to your stamina.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hand-Eye Coordination</td>
	<td>HEC</td>
    <td>Represents your hand-eye coordination..... Used for shooting, driving, flying, playing instruments, and lock picking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Awareness</td>
	<td>AWR</td>
    <td>Represents your ability to react quickly to events and stimuli. Used to determine if you can react to sudden things in time, to dodge, and to notice physical things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Logic</td>
	<td>LOG</td>
    <td>Represents your IQ, or ability to apply formal logic and reason. Used for deduction, programming, solving puzzles, learning, and understanding concepts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Empathy</td>
	<td>EMP</td>
    <td>Represents you EQ, or ability to read and understand other people. Used for persuading, determining others intent, and understanding other people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mindfulness</td>
	<td>MIN</td>
    <td>Represents how in control you are of your emotions, and self aware you are of yourself. Used for resisting negative mental states or stress, or resisting pain and other impulses.</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Strikes</h3>
<aside>
<p>Why these three stats? Beyond the fact they are the ones you would use to avoid dying, they are also the least conventionally useful out of the seven, helping to balance your choices.</p>
</aside>
<p>Next you should calculate and fill in your number of "strikes". These represent your health, or ability to avoid negative consequences during play. Total up your <b>BRN</b>, <b>AWR</b>, &#38; <b>MIN</b>, and compare the total to the following Table</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <td>0-6</td>
    <td>7-8</td>
	<td>9-10</td>
    <td>11-12</td>
    <td>13+</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Strikes</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
	<td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>Finally you should select modifications. By default you have <b>two</b> points to spend on the following table. Taking negative modifications will allow you to get more then two points of positive modifications.</p>
<table class="c">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
	<th>Cost</th>
	<th>Impact</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Special Skill</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>Select a skill that you character has &#40;e.g. Driving Cars, Flying Fighter Jets, Running Marathons, Auditing Financial Statements, etc.&#41;. The skill should include the thing you do, and what it applies to &#40;Shooting Sniper Rifles no just Shooting&#41;. Gain +2 to all skill checks using that skill. Can be taken twice for a given skill, for +4.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Positive Attribute</td>
	<td>4</td>
    <td>Add 1 to an attribute, this cannot take an attribute over 5 without GM permission. This can be taken multiple times. Note this can only be taken at character generation without GM permission.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Negative Attribute</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>Subtract 1 from an attribute, this cannot take an attribute under 1 without GM permission. This can be taken multiple times. Note this can only be taken at character generation without GM permission. This is often used once to represent a middle aged character, or twice to represent an old one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Sight</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You have excellent vision. Gain +2 to REA tests, where the threat is visible. Do not apply penalties to checks for objects/targets being to small to see, or to far away &#40;e.g. if a skill test would normally be hard to spot a symbol on a wall since it is 50m away, treat it as normal instead&#41;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Hearing</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You have excellent hearing. Gain +2 to REA tests, where the threat is audible, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand noises.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Taste</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of taste. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can taste the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand flavour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Touch</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of touch. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can feel the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand something tactile.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Smell</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of smell. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can smell the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand and aroma.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blind</td>
	<td>-2</td>
    <td>You are blind. Reduce HEC to 0. In addition to the base 2 negative modification points, gain another 4 for every point of attribute that you lost.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deaf</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>You are deaf.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Partially Paralyzed</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>You are in a wheel chair, and are reliant on it to move around. BRN &#38; ATH cannot be over 4. This can also be used to model other mobility disabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fully Paralyzed</td>
	<td>-8</td>
    <td>You are in a motorized wheel chair, and are reliant on it to move around. BRN &#38; ATH cannot be over 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attractive</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You are attractive. Gain +2 to any social skill checks with someone who would be sexually interested in you &#40;Consider Sex, Orientation, and Species&#41;. Test either needs to be in person, or with someone that has meet you in person before, and knows who you are. You are also more memorable, making NPCs remembering you easier, and you being able to go unnoticed harder (increasing or decreasing the difficulty on skill checks). Can be taken a second time, increasing the benefits to +4, and making NPCs notice you immediately, and rarely forget you were there (increasing or decreasing the difficulty on skill checks).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Disfigured</td>
	<td>-2</td>
    <td>Your appearance is disturbing to others. This will make all social checks with people who can see you harder (increasing the difficulty on skill checks). Can be used to model being ugly, heavily scared, or otherwise malformed.</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Other Items</h3>
<p>Money and objects are not tracked by default in the game. The characters have what would make sense given their backgrounds and current roles.</p>
<h1 id="General_Rules">General Rules</h1>
<p>These are the rules for playing the game as a player. Some items relevant just to the GM are in the next section.</p> 
<h2 id="Skill_Checks">Skill Checks</h2>
<p>The core mechanic of the game is a skill check. Any time you are trying to do something that has a real chance of failing you need to make a skill check to see what the outcome is.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine if a check should even happen. The GM should determine if the character can even do the thing they are trying to do, if the task is impossible do not do a check. If it is possible, then the GM should then determine if there is a real chance of someone failing at the thing they are attempting &#40;The Everyone is John Corollary&#41;. In both cases a rough guide is &quot;is there both a greater then 2% chance of this working and failing &quot; or &quot;if the character did this every day for two months, would it happen on at least one day, but not occur every day&quot;. So you should not have a check to drive to work, or to drive your car to the moon.</p>
<p>Assuming you have determined this should be a check, next determine which of you attributes is the one being tested &#40;e.g. HEC for shooting a gun&#41. This should usually be clear, but if it isn't the GM has the final call on which one is being used. Next you need to determine if you are skilled at what you are trying to do. This is primarily driven by your characters job &#40;so a marine would be skilled shooting a gun&#41;, but the rest of your characters background is also relevant &#40;The same marine may be skilled at flying a plane if flying Cessna is their hobby&#41;. This is again the final call of the GM</p>
<p>Now the GM should determine the difficulty of the task, this will determine the target number &#40;TN&#41;.</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>Very Hard</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>TN</th>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>10</td>
	<td>13</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <aside>
<p>&quot;What about combat?&quot; What about combat. This is the same system that is used for breaking people and killing things, the way to think about it is that the weapons, armour, and relative positioning define the difficulty of the check. So if I am trying to shoot someone unarmoured with a pistol my chances of incapacitating them is roughly equal to my chances of hitting them somewhere on their body. If they are wearing a bulletproof vest now my chances are lower since I need to hit them somewhere the vest isn't. But if they have a vest and I am shooting them with a larger rifle that can go through it, we are back up to the odds of hitting them somewhere on their body. So for combat consider the weapon &amp; armour, and determine how hard it would be to hit a place where the weapon would incapacitate someone. So in the previous example, shooting a guy in a bulletproof vest with a pistol is hard, with a rifle is normal, and with a rocket launcher is hard again &#40;since its lethal no matter where you make contact, but actually hitting a person sized target with a rocket is hard&#41;.</p>
</aside>
<p>When setting the difficulty you should consider the inherent nature of the thing the character is attempting, but also the surrounding circumstances. So convincing someone to help you search for a lost dog might be a normal test, while it would be hard if the person hates dogs, or very hard if that dog has bitten them. Most tasks will end up being normal, and this represents most things a character would do where there are decent odds things could go either way.</p>
<p>Now the player rolls 2D6, adds the related attribute, and any positive or negative adjustments from modifiers the character has. If the result is equal of higher then the TR it succeeds, lower it fails.&#40;TN&#41;.</p>
<p>If it is possible for a check to succeed more then a normal success &#40;e.g. a check to see if you make money playing poker&#41;, you should give the character another increment of success for every 3 points they beat the TR by. So if I am playing poker and its a normal check to win, if I roll 13 in total I should win even more money &#40;like they passed a hard check&#41;</p>
<p>The GM does not have to tell the player what the difficulty of the check is, if they think the character in game either wouldn't know or is working with bad information.</p>

<h2 id="Strikes">Strikes</h2>
<p>Each character has a number of strikes. That character can burn a strike to avoid one instance of negative circumstances. This could be something like getting shot, being crushed in a car crash, or going insane seeing the Dread Cthulhu. They cannot be used to make a check work, just to avoid the personal negative consequences &#40;survive a plane crash, not stop the plane from crashing&#41;. In game this would represent the character either dodging, toughing out the physical damage, or having the mental fortitude to power through, at the players discretion.</p>
<p>Strikes are restored at the GMs discretion, but would generally be back to full at the start of the next adventure.</p>
<h2 id="Initiative">Initiative</h2>
<p>In cases where you need to determine who acts first, you would normally rely on context &#40;if someone starts shooting first, they go first&#41;. If it is unclear you can either have the relevant parties role REA tests, or just compare their REA stats to see who acts first.</p>
<h2 id="NPCs">NPCs</h2>
<p>This section covers characters that are not players, and are controlled by the GM. There are two types.</p>
 <aside>
<p>&quot;Why 1D6+3?&quot; Because for all results it is equal or worse then 2D6 &#40;Given 1s for Mooks always fail&#41; and means you can roll checks for many of them at once.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Mooks</h3>
<p>These are any NPCs that are not major characters. They have no strikes, so any action that would incapacitate them takes them out of the game. When rolling a skill check with them, roll 1D6+3. Rolls of 1 always fail for Mooks.</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>These are any NPCs that are major characters. Build then and treat them like they are player characters, rolling 2D6 for their skill checks, and and tracking their strikes.</p>
<h2 id="Statuses_and_Effects">Statuses and Effects</h2>
<aside>
<p>Particularly if you are playing in person, it is useful to either have cards with these written on them, or to freehand them on strips of paper when they come up, and hand them to the player as a tangible reminder of the impact. That way they are tracking it not you.</p>
</aside>
<p>The impact of actions taken by the players or NPCs may have more lasting impacts on other characters. This could include things like being bruised from a punch, or blinded by flight, or drunk. To represent these, the characters impacted should have a negative modifier to one or more of their attributes until it goes away. Although examples are listed bellow they are not exhaustive.</p>

<h1 id="Setting1">Eldritch Horrors by Post</h1>
<p>A modern setting, of fighting off the multi-dimensioned horrors from beyond space time.</p>
<h2 id="Background1">Background</h2>
<p><i> Exerted from the "USPIS Field Guide to Obscene and Blasphemous Material - 2018 edition"</i></p>
<h3>The Long War</h3>
<p>We are not alone, but God I wish we were. Based on the fact you are reading this, you have been exposed to some parts of this truth, but to drill it home there are many different.... entities, that are beyond our comprehension and mean us harm. Creatures who exist on to many dimensions and in to many universes at once, and are constantly attempting to enter our world. The good news is that without the help of something on this side, all they can do is shake their appendages in rage, the bad news is people continue to think that assisting them is a good idea. Whether they are doing it for power, wealth, or to understand the mysteries of the universe, it amounts to the same thing, they need to be stopped.</p>
<p>The issue is that to know or understand these creatures or their <del>magics</del> works, is to be driven to utter insanity. We are not capable of viewing these entities, or using their powers without out physical and mental forms collapsing.<strong>There are No Exceptions</strong>. There is no way to safely cast a spell or someone an entity, to use those powers is to know them is to be broken.</p>
<p>So how do you fight something you axiomatically do not understand? Through inference. For the last 3700+ years our professional forebears have been attempting to back into what these things are capable of, and what drives them. It's not perfect, but having a good idea what the eldritch is trying to do is better then knowing and now being in league with them. As for their accoutrements, the books, scrolls, ritual objects, &amp; cultists, <strong>Burn Them All</strong>. As a wise man once noted its the only way to be sure.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the End of the World</h3>
<p>"Really, the post office?" is still the most common question that I get from new hires into our service. And unfortunately there isn't a great answer to that that doesn't at least touch on the history of our agency and these united states. After our independence some method of policing and obliterating the Eldritch was needed, and even under the articles of confederation no one thought it was a great idea to leave it to the several states. So there was a need to find some way of quietly keeping the countries witch finders on payroll, and under observation by a higher authority. Given that at the time there was only one federal organization that was charged with broad law enforcement responsibilities, we ended up here. With a plausible reason to travel all over the country, and the ability, nay duty to open and inspect the mail, the USPIS as it would come to eventually be know, was a great cover for our operations, and a chance to try and cut off questionable materials before they get to their recipients.</p>
<p>In those early days we followed the traditional approach of burning everything, and killing any compromised cultists on site, on the basis that its better to limit how many people hear or know about these things. All it takes is 1 in 1000 people to think a greater summoning ritual is a great idea, and we are fucked. So we destroyed and covered up everything so people wouldn't get ideas. This lasted until the early 20th century when a combination of massive population growth mass literacy was threatening our grip on the situation. With some many people and so many readers, it became harder and harder to even detect the issues in time, and the general public often didn't even know something was wrong until it was to late. Enter our greatest success "HP Lovecraft". The decision was made to start publishing older case files &#40;With substantial changes&#41; so that the general public would know what to look out for, and raise the alarm far faster. As well thanks to the rise of fantasy and sci fi fiction in this period, we no longer had to be worried about people "taking it seriously". In fact this helped ensure that if most people did come across the real thing they would think it was an unpublished novel or a joke, as well as making it next to impossible for actual cultists to track down true tests among the flood of knock-offs.</p>
<p>These days there are almost 150 of us "BookBurners" across the country, holding the line. In addition since the 50s we have been increasing assisted by our cell in the NSA &#40;Commonly Called the "Black Chamber", after someone pointed out that their job was to literally read other people's mail.&#41;. The letter ain't what is used to be, so we are reliant on them to provide leads form emails and other digital communications.</p>
<h3>Legal Cover</h3>
<p>The next question I usually get asked is "How is Any of This Legal?", which is a good question given all the manslaying and arson we do. The short answer is that at Common Law anyone consorting with 'Wyrd or Magique' powers is Caput lupinum or Outlawed, without right to trial or benefit of the clergy. In fact any freeman seeing someone doing said consorting was obliged to try and end them. Similarly any creature considered 'Fiend and Dæmon', or any materials relating to these subjects were to be destroyed wherever they were found with no penalty. And thanks to a few early decisions by John Marshall, these common law precepts are not only still in effect, but normal constitutional protections do not override them. As for why we have not updated them, well you tell me how getting a new law passed goes for you.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that if you see someone doing magic yourself, you have every right and duty to put that person in the ground. And that goes double for creatures beyond spacetime and the books that brought them here. That's not to say there is no oversight, there is. First the federal courts have jurisdiction over our activities. Every circuit has at least one justice who is clued in, and after any operation we are required to deposit a report of what went happened with them for ratification. And if it gets particularly contentious, the three relevant members of SCOTUS are perfectly willing to step in to settle it. Beyond the judiciary though, we are also governed by the commissioners, nine individuals appointed by the president to govern our activities. Those are the gentlemen who you will be asking for support from if you need resources not immediately available to you &#40;A10s don't grow on trees&#41;, and who will reign you in &#40;With lead if needed&#41;, if you step over the line.</p>
<p>As for your personal powers, you have a commission from the president in your pocket outlining the authority you have been delegated with. This surprisingly does not include the afore mentioned manslaying and arson &#40;Since those Common Law powers are available to everyone&#41; but instead cover additional federal powers you have been invested with. Of particular note if a power of arrest, the power to raise the Posse Comitatus as required, and crucially "to direct all federal forces and resources, both civil and military as required". So theoretically the entire forces of the united states are at your disposal, practically the nice air force wing commander is unlikely to listen to you with a call from his superiors. </p>
<p>There are two other legal items that need to be touched on. First in cases where individuals were involved in these affairs, but did not directly cast spells or consort with the Eldrich, they need to be arrested, then relaxed to the civil authority &#40;the judge&#41;. Now if you are resisting arrest.... things happen, but you can't just shoot them out of head. Second while you have immense powers to do your job, your bosses and the world at large cares far more about keeping a lid on the truth. While they will help stop murder investigations from following up on you after the fact, if someone gets you on video gunning a possessed kindergarten teacher they are going to cut you loose instead.</p>
<h3>International</h3>
<h2 id="Threat1">The Threat</h2>
<p><i> Further exerts from the "USPIS Field Guide to Obscene and Blasphemous Material - 2018 edition"</i></p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>In line with international practice, we try to classify threats based on what they pose an existential threat to. As such Class 0, are threats that even if allowed to operate unhindered would not end or compromise the future existence of the human race. Class 1 threats are an existential to towns, cities, provinces, and states. If we would lose 6 senators tops to the thing, its class 1. Class 2 threats are existential to regions, countries, and continents. If it could wipe out anything from France to Europe et al, it falls here. Class 3 threats are an existential threat to humanity, their success would imply that we would not be able to go on in anything resembling what we consider life. We do not differentiate between merely wiping us out, destroying the planet, or breaking reality, our job is to get the great hairless plains ape through this intact, if we go the fate of reality can hang.</p>
<h3>Lizardmen</h3>
<p>Lizardmen are one of the oldest threats that humanity has had to face. We have records of them going back as far as we still have records in places as far flung as the Levant, Mesoamerica, and the Philippines, and we have found physical remnants even older then that. They are capable of disguising their appearance behind various sorceries, and appearing human. Their usual modus operandi being infiltrating elite circles, and trying to take over societies and governments. While there eventual goals are not truly knowable, their usual end game seems to be mass human sacrifice in an attempt to manifest their God. While this entity has been referred to by literally hundreds of names &#40;e.g. Ningishzida, Aido Hwedo, Quetzalcoatl)&#41;, based on the similarities on the recovered sites it appears to be the same entity.</p>
<p>Lizardmen reach maturity at 4'6'' - 5'0'' tall, but never stop growing later in life. The largest one recorded was measured 22'7'' from snout to tail when its cadaver was measured. While these larger forms are disturbing, they are not avatars or aspects of their god, and die like anything else. Being cold blooded they strongly prefer hot climates, and are basically never found in areas that drop below freezing.</p>
<h3>He of One Thousand Faces</h3>
<p>He of One Thousand Faces, is one of the most effective and devious of the Eldritch creatures which we have faced. This creature is formed when a human is subjected to a ritual, commonly referred to as the royal call. This involves creating a circle bound in other eldritch symbols, putting a human in the middle and singing the relevant ballad. We are unclear at this stage if the ritual causes a single entity in question to then take over the body of the victim, and each recorded case is the same entity, or if the ritual merely drives the target insane and gifts it highly specific powers. But in either case the person is gone, replaced with the avatar of He of One Thousand Faces.</p>
<p>The avatar is noted for its ability to take over the appearance and mannerisms of different humans it has encountered nearly at will, morphing its flesh and bone to meet the new form. Given its mastery over its physical form it is very very hard to kill. Things like bullets and blades are at best temporary inconveniences. Historically the only way to completely disincorporate the entity is to totally envelop it in industrial strength fire &#40;see the <i>Trinity Test Memo</i> for more information on the last successful destruction of this entity&#41;</p>
<p>Unlike other entities who destroy human minds incidentally through our inability to comprehend them, the main goal of He of One Thousand Faces is to spread madness amongst humanity. It seems to both delight in the chaos it causes and understands humans well enough to find new methods of doing so. Historically it's main method was to disseminate cursed narrative works &#40;see files on <i>el rei de groc &#40;1351CE&#41;</i>, <i>Macbeth &#40;Bad Quarto - 1619CE&#41;</i>, <i>Tale of the Yellow Emperor &#40;341CE&#41;</i>, and <i>The Yellow Sign &#40;326BC - 1967AD various&#41;</i>&#41;. These works have evolved with whatever the dominant medium is for spreading stories, from plays in times of pre-literacy, to novels, to in more modern times films, and is constantly being adapted into whatever languages are modern at the time. In all cases people who witness these performances are compelled to watch them through to the end, and driven totally mad.</p>
<p>This entity does not have a consistent cult, instead deranged individuals seem to come upon the idea of summoning it on their own. We have not been able to determine conclusively to date whether this comes from the entity reaching out to communicate with them directly, them finding a triggering recording or written work, or if it is just a failure mode built into humans.</p>
<p>In no circumstances is an agent to read or witness any of these works. Any copies identified must be destroyed immediately. Also do not run them through computers or other scanning systems, the danger is in the content itself not its presentation, and low level sentience is also impacted &#40;see the <i>Cyberdyne Systems Incident Report</i>&#41;</p>
<h3>The Black Pharaoh</h3>
<p>The Black Pharaoh is a class 2 entity, which is currently contained within the Pyramid of Menkaure, located outside of Cairo, Egypt. The entity is believed to have been active some time before 5000BCE, dominating the various societies around what would become the Western Mediterranean and the Levant. It is unclear whether this entity was originally some sort of elder god, or a cultist who became sufficiently twisted that it elevated, but it's goals seemed to be establishing its absolute authority over human behavior, and establishing increasing severe penalties for non-compliance &#40;see the report on <i>Qin Shi Huang</i> for possible parallel/duplicate/similarly empowered case&#41;. Eventually the entity seems to have been contained within the Pyramid in question, and it has been trapped there ever since.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made subsequently to free this entity &#40;see <i>Al-Aziz Uthman</i> report for more details&#41; but most of the attempts over the last 500 years have focused around the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh. They are a widespread cult that has attempted to use various rituals, human sacrifice, cannibalism, imperial policy, anti-imperial policy, theology, and improvised explosives to free their master. Given their authoritarian and sociopathic inclinations, they have been successful in the past in infiltrating normal civil and governmental organizations, and trying to turn those resources to the task.</p>
<h3>Fishmen "Deep Ones"</h3>
<p>The Deep Ones are probably our greatest success, but that has ironically come at the cost of agents underestimating or misunderstanding them. Yes these are the famous fishmen that breed with human woman then walk back into the sea, but if you base your strategy on the stories you will die badly. So we are going to illustrate all the places where they differ from the novel. First they do not live in New England, in fact they avoid deep water entirely. You are far more likely to find them in Florida or Vietnam, then any place with a thriving cod industry. The reason why brings us to the second difference, they are nominally mammals, not fish. They live in shallow brackish waters since they need to surface for air daily, and want places they will not easily be spotted. Third they do not worship Cthulhu, but rather something we call "The Dragon", so you can leave your plushies at home.</p>
<p>As for their goals, they do seem dedicated to bringing about some sort of rapture in the long run, a great flood that would increase their amount of usable real-estate, and remove the threat of humans at the same time. But generally they are hybridizing with humans to get local support, and redirect authorities away from their lairs. While the rituals that created them, and allowed them to hybridize with humans are still of unknown creation, our best guess is that some party in pre-history created them out of Manatees, explaining their mammalian origins, and allowing them to retain the further ability to splice genes with other intelligent creatures. The process today is wholly biological and does not require a ritual or spell. That is not to say they are lacking in that department, their shamans are capable of calling forth all manner of horrors.</p>
<p>In terms of counter measures, one of our best resources is the nominal source of the problem, Manatees. As it turns out they are far, far, far smarter then you would be lead to believe, and they are immune to most of the magics that the fishmen employ. We have worked with their officials in the past to locate and eliminate nests, in exchange for other assistance in kind &#40;see notes on <i>Jacksonville Accords - 1972</i> for more details on the resulting regulations on motorized vessels in the Western Hemisphere&#41;</p>
<h3>Hastlyk</h3>
<p>One of the famed "Elder Gods", Hastlyk &#40;Obviously not its true name&#41; is a force of unbridled, unrestrained growth and life. Whether horrific physical mutations, new viruses, or the spontaneous creation of parasites, this entity "blesses" its followers and foes with things Monsanto could only dream of. It's cults operate under hundreds of different names, but trend towards more natural movements, like organic foods, traditional medicine, or anti-vaxers. While most of its cultists do not realize the full extent of what they are trying to bring into the world, they have the potential of wiping out all of us if they get luckier with the next SARS.</p>
<h3>Babbles</h3>
<p>Babbles &#40;a.k.a. <i>vox satanae</i>, <i>Tongue&#45;Theifs</i>, <i>Qōl Nāḥāš</i>, <i>Face&#45;Huggers</i>&#41; are parasitic organisms which consume the tongue of a human and take its place, hijacking the central nervous system of the target, and controlling the humans movements and functions. Even while controlling a human, the Babble still needs to eat and breath separately from its host, both of which it does from its maw on the end of the &#34;tongue&#34;. Babbles are able to retain some of the memories of the target after taking them over, including knowledge of language, and are able to speak and communicate with humans through their maw.</p>
<p>While their origins must lie in some sort of ritual in the early days of man &#40;see the <i>Migdal Bavel Review &#40;1928CE&#41;</i>, for likely originating event&#41;, they operate on a biological basis and do not require any sort of sorcery to reproduce, in spite of their ability to communicate telepathically with each other at short range. They have been found basically everywhere in Eurasia across written history, and have since spread to the rest of the world as transportation has improved.</p>
<p>While we still do not know what their ultimate goals are &#40;see the <i>Guatemala Experimental Results &#40;1946&#45;1948CE&#41;</i>, for failed attempt to interrogate&#41;, we do know that at every chance they will try to grow their numbers exponentially, and need to be stamped out quickly when found to prevent broader contagion &#40;see the <i>Mary Kay Incident &#40;1972CE&#41;</i>, for a contemporary example&#41;. One sign of potential infestation are subjects wearing face masks at all times &#40;to hide monster in their throat&#41; and agents are warned that normally fatal wounds dealt to Babble controlled humans, may not be effective if they do not hit the Babble (tongue) directly.</p>	
<h2 id="Rules1">Setting Rules</h2>
<p>Assume the base rules are in effect unless otherwise contradicted here.</p>
<h3>Strikes</h3>
<p>Strikes can only be used on physical tangible threats &#40;e.g. bullets, claws, cars&#41;. Strikes recover in the same way as in the base rules. Add together your BRN &amp; AWR, and compare it against the following table.</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <td>0-3</td>
    <td>4-5</td>
	<td>6-7</td>
    <td>8-10</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Strikes</th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Sanity</h3>
<p>You have 'Sanity Strikes', equal to your MIN stat. Every time you understand someone that is Eldritch &#40;e.g. read a book, see a Horror, hear a cursed play&#41; lose a Sanity Strike. Note that its not enough to be near it, if you don't get it it doesn't have an effect. For example if you were reading a cursed book, the GM might ask you to make a LOG skill test, if you pass you lose one sanity strike. Similarly you have roll AWR to see if you notice the wrong shape of something. Unlike normal for many of these checks you would want to fail. These points would regenerate between sessions at the GMs discretion, but consider how much time it would take to forget some of these things.</p>
<p>If a character loses all their sanity strikes, two things happen. First these are out of the scene/mission. But second the GM in consultation with the player should select one modification off the following table, as a permanent impact to the character.</p>
<table class="a b">
  <tr>
    <th>Modification</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Impact</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alcoholic</td>
    <td>Turn to Drink to deal with the dreams</td>
    <td>TBA</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
