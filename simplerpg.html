<h1 id="SimpleRPG">SimpleRPG</h1> 
<p>A Generic Roll-Playing System that Doesn't Suck.</p> 
<h2>Table of contents</h2> 
<a href="SimpleRPG">Jump to the part of the page with the “anchor-name” id </a>
<h1>Background</h1> 
<p>The purpose of this system is to have a bare-bones RPG that can be used to either a&#41; spin up a game quickly, or b&#41; serve as the foundation for a more built out game on top of it. I will leave notes inline as I go, but there are two things it is trying to solve. One is downtime at the table, every minute someone is looking up a rule, or more often consulting their sheet to see what skills even exist that may cover this scenario, is time that the game grinds to a halt. So it is built from the ground up to be a system where all the reference materials for running it fit on a page, and the players need a playing card at most. Second this system is designed to serve as the base resolution layer for any type of RPG on top, and as such has no dedicated combat rules in it. If you want to run a big shooting game, then that probably makes sense as something to bolt on, but there are lots of options for mechanics in games that are not "shoot the man" or more recently "track my social bonds with the man". So if you were trying to get your 'Drive to Survive' game, or 'Stardew Valley' knock off going, this is the place.</p> 
<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>To start with, you need to understand the world this is taking place in, and what your place in that world would be. So the GM needs to tell you what the background is, for you to start with character creation.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Fill in the following &#40;not necessarily in order&#41;</p>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>What is your characters name?</p>
<h3>Vital Statistics</h3>
<aside>
<p>To avoid a lot of trouble down the road, elfs & dwarfs & humans are all different species, not races. "Races" are about cultural background, societal perception, and visual differentiation, they do not mark meaningful biological differences. Good rule of thumb, is will you get fertile offspring crossing the two groups, if not you have species not races.</p>
</aside>
<p>Height, Weight, Sex, Race, Species, Religion, Caste, Scars, Tattoos, Hair/Eye colour, etc. These will differ in importance based on the campaign, but at least in broad terms you should put down how someone in this world would tell you apart visually from someone else based your appearance, and any immutable physiological facts about you. So saying tall or overweight is fine, but if elfs and gnomes are literal separate specifies in your world, you should mark which. Adding a picture also helps a lot.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Put down a few sentences of how you got to the point in time you are starting the campaign. Like a sentence for birth through adolescence, another through end of education, and whatever you need to cover what came after that. It does not need to be extensive, but should cover off who your character is.</p>
<blockquote>Austin was born in Western Canada to two English speaking science profs, and raised in a few different cities across the Canadian prairies as his family found better roles in different universities. Graduated from a public high school in Saskatoon, having focused mostly on theatre & academics, and ended up with a MEng then MBA from UBC. Currently lives in Seattle with his girlfriend Jullie, working at Microsoft, and enjoys amateur dramatics in his spare time.</blockquote> 
<h3>Job</h3>
<p>What is your characters job, the thing they get paid for and are good at? Should be 1-3 words, like 'accountant' or 'police sergeant' or 'mercenary'. </p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>Next you need to choose your characters mechanical elements.</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>First you need to set your characters attributes, they are used for resolving actions and checks during the game. Your character has seven attributes that all start at <b>1</b>. You have <b>15</b> points to increase them, costing <b>one</b> point to raise any attribute by <b>one</b>, and you cannot increase an attribute over <b>five</b>.</p>
<p>The "Average" attribute is 3, increasing and decreasing in standard deviations. So 2 is bad, 1 is terrible, 4 is good, 5 is incredible.</p>
<img src="AttributeCurve.PNG"
     style="object-fit:contain;
            width:800px;
            height:auto"/>
<p>The seven attributes are as follows:</p>
<table class="c">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
	<th>ABRV</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brawn</td>
	<td>BRN</td>
    <td>How large, strong, and tough you are. Used for lifting, pulling, breaking, and dealing with the consequences of physical harm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Athletics</td>
	<td>ATH</td>
    <td>Represents how in shape and athletically capable you are. Used for running, swimming, jumping, swinging, and things relating to your stamina.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hand-Eye Coordination</td>
	<td>HEC</td>
    <td>Represents your hand-eye coordination..... Used for shooting, driving, flying, playing instruments, and lock picking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Awareness</td>
	<td>AWR</td>
    <td>Represents your ability to react quickly to events and stimuli. Used to determine if you can react to sudden things in time, to dodge, and to notice physical things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Logic</td>
	<td>LOG</td>
    <td>Represents your IQ, or ability to apply formal logic and reason. Used for deduction, programming, solving puzzles, learning, and understanding concepts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Empathy</td>
	<td>EMP</td>
    <td>Represents you EQ, or ability to read and understand other people. Used for persuading, determining others intent, and understanding other people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mindfulness</td>
	<td>MIN</td>
    <td>Represents how in control you are of your emotions, and self aware you are of yourself. Used for resisting negative mental states or stress, or resisting pain and other impulses.</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Strikes</h3>
<aside>
<p>Why these three stats? Beyond the fact they are the ones you would use to avoid dying, they are also the least conventionally useful out of the seven, helping to balance your choices.</p>
</aside>
<p>Next you should calculate and fill in your number of "strikes". These represent your health, or ability to avoid negative consequences during play. Total up your <b>BRN</b>, <b>AWR</b>, &#38; <b>MIN</b>, and compare the total to the following Table</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <td>0-6</td>
    <td>7-8</td>
	<td>9-10</td>
    <td>11-12</td>
    <td>13+</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Strikes</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
	<td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>Finally you should select modifications. By default you have <b>two</b> points to spend on the following table. Taking negative modifications will allow you to get more then two points of positive modifications.</p>
<table class="c">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
	<th>Cost</th>
	<th>Impact</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Special Skill</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>Select a skill that you character has &#40;e.g. Driving Cars, Flying Fighter Jets, Running Marathons, Auditing Financial Statements, etc.&#41;. The skill should include the thing you do, and what it applies to &#40;Shooting Sniper Rifles no just Shooting&#41;. Gain +2 to all skill checks using that skill. Can be taken twice for a given skill, for +4.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Positive Attribute</td>
	<td>4</td>
    <td>Add 1 to an attribute, this cannot take an attribute over 5 without GM permission. This can be taken multiple times. Note this can only be taken at character generation without GM permission.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Negative Attribute</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>Subtract 1 from an attribute, this cannot take an attribute under 1 without GM permission. This can be taken multiple times. Note this can only be taken at character generation without GM permission. This is often used once to represent a middle aged character, or twice to represent an old one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Sight</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You have excellent vision. Gain +2 to REA tests, where the threat is visible. Do not apply penalties to checks for objects/targets being to small to see, or to far away &#40;e.g. if a skill test would normally be hard to spot a symbol on a wall since it is 50m away, treat it as normal instead&#41;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Hearing</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You have excellent hearing. Gain +2 to REA tests, where the threat is audible, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand noises.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Taste</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of taste. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can taste the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand flavour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Touch</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of touch. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can feel the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand something tactile.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heightened Sense - Smell</td>
	<td>1</td>
    <td>You have an excellent sense of smell. Gain +2 to REA tests, where you can smell the threat, and +2 for any skill tests where you are trying to detect or understand and aroma.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blind</td>
	<td>-2</td>
    <td>You are blind. Reduce HEC to 0. In addition to the base 2 negative modification points, gain another 4 for every point of attribute that you lost.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deaf</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>You are deaf.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Partially Paralyzed</td>
	<td>-4</td>
    <td>You are in a wheel chair, and are reliant on it to move around. BRN &#38; ATH cannot be over 4. This can also be used to model other mobility disabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fully Paralyzed</td>
	<td>-8</td>
    <td>You are in a motorized wheel chair, and are reliant on it to move around. BRN &#38; ATH cannot be over 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attractive</td>
	<td>2</td>
    <td>You are attractive. Gain +2 to any social skill checks with someone who would be sexually interested in you &#40;Consider Sex, Orientation, and Species&#41;. Test either needs to be in person, or with someone that has meet you in person before, and knows who you are. You are also more memorable, making NPCs remembering you easier, and you being able to go unnoticed harder (increasing or decreasing the difficulty on skill checks). Can be taken a second time, increasing the benefits to +4, and making NPCs notice you immediately, and rarely forget you were there (increasing or decreasing the difficulty on skill checks).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Disfigured</td>
	<td>-2</td>
    <td>Your appearance is disturbing to others. This will make all social checks with people who can see you harder (increasing the difficulty on skill checks). Can be used to model being ugly, heavily scared, or otherwise malformed.</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<h3>Other Items</h3>
<p>Money and objects are not tracked by default in the game. The characters have what would make sense given their backgrounds and current roles.</p>
<h1>Rules</h1> 
<p>These are the rules for playing the game as a player. Some items relevant just to the GM are in the next section.</p> 
<h2>Skill Checks</h2>
<p>The core mechanic of the game is a skill check. Any time you are trying to do something that has a real chance of failing you need to make a skill check to see what the outcome is.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine if a check should even happen. The GM should determine if the character can even do the thing they are trying to do, if the task is impossible do not do a check. If it is possible, then the GM should then determine if there is a real chance of someone failing at the thing they are attempting &#40;The Everyone is John Corollary&#41;. In both cases a rough guide is &quot;is there both a greater then 2% chance of this working and failing &quot; or &quot;if the character did this every day for two months, would it happen on at least one day, but not occur every day&quot;. So you should not have a check to drive to work, or to drive your car to the moon.</p>
<p>Assuming you have determined this should be a check, next determine which of you attributes is the one being tested &#40;e.g. HEC for shooting a gun&#41. This should usually be clear, but if it isn't the GM has the final call on which one is being used. Next you need to determine if you are skilled at what you are trying to do. This is primarily driven by your characters job &#40;so a marine would be skilled shooting a gun&#41;, but the rest of your characters background is also relevant &#40;The same marine may be skilled at flying a plane if flying Cessna is their hobby&#41;. This is again the final call of the GM</p>
<p>Now the GM should determine the difficulty of the task, this will determine the target number &#40;TN&#41;.</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>Very Hard</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <th>TN</th>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>10</td>
	<td>13</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <aside>
<p>&quot;What about combat?&quot; What about combat. This is the same system that is used for breaking people and killing things, the way to think about it is that the weapons, armour, and relative positioning define the difficulty of the check. So if I am trying to shoot someone unarmoured with a pistol my chances of incapacitating them is roughly equal to my chances of hitting them somewhere on their body. If they are wearing a bulletproof vest now my chances are lower since I need to hit them somewhere the vest isn't. But if they have a vest and I am shooting them with a larger rifle that can go through it, we are back up to the odds of hitting them somewhere on their body. So for combat consider the weapon &amp; armour, and determine how hard it would be to hit a place where the weapon would incapacitate someone. So in the previous example, shooting a guy in a bulletproof vest with a pistol is hard, with a rifle is normal, and with a rocket launcher is hard again &#40;since its lethal no matter where you make contact, but actually hitting a person sized target with a rocket is hard&#41;.</p>
</aside>
<p>When setting the difficulty you should consider the inherent nature of the thing the character is attempting, but also the surrounding circumstances. So convincing someone to help you search for a lost dog might be a normal test, while it would be hard if the person hates dogs, or very hard if that dog has bitten them. Most tasks will end up being normal, and this represents most things a character would do where there are decent odds things could go either way.</p>
<p>Now the player rolls 2D6, adds the related attribute, and any positive or negative adjustments from modifiers the character has. If the result is equal of higher then the TR it succeeds, lower it fails.&#40;TN&#41;.</p>
<p>If it is possible for a check to succeed more then a normal success &#40;e.g. a check to see if you make money playing poker&#41;, you should give the character another increment of success for every 3 points they beat the TR by. So if I am playing poker and its a normal check to win, if I roll 13 in total I should win even more money &#40;like they passed a hard check&#41;</p>
<p>The GM does not have to tell the player what the difficulty of the check is, if they think the character in game either wouldn't know or is working with bad information.</p>

<h2>Strikes</h2>
<p>Each character has a number of strikes. That character can burn a strike to avoid one instance of negative circumstances. This could be something like getting shot, being crushed in a car crash, or going insane seeing the Dread Cthulhu. They cannot be used to make a check work, just to avoid the personal negative consequences &#40;survive a plane crash, not stop the plane from crashing&#41;. In game this would represent the character either dodging, toughing out the physical damage, or having the mental fortitude to power through, at the players discretion.</p>
<p>Strikes are restored at the GMs discretion, but would generally be back to full at the start of the next adventure.</p>
<h2>Initiative</h2>
<p>In cases where you need to determine who acts first, you would normally rely on context &#40;if someone starts shooting first, they go first&#41;. If it is unclear you can either have the relevant parties role REA tests, or just compare their REA stats to see who acts first.</p>
<h2>NPCs</h2>
<p>This section covers characters that are not players, and are controlled by the GM. There are two types.</p>
 <aside>
<p>&quot;Why 1D6+3?&quot; Because for all results it is equal or worse then 2D6 &#40;Given 1s for Mooks always fail&#41; and means you can roll checks for many of them at once.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Mooks</h3>
<p>These are any NPCs that are not major characters. They have no strikes, so any action that would incapacitate them takes them out of the game. When rolling a skill check with them, roll 1D6+3. Rolls of 1 always fail for Mooks.</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>These are any NPCs that are major characters. Build then and treat them like they are player characters, rolling 2D6 for their skill checks, and and tracking their strikes.</p>
<h2>Statuses and Effects</h2>
<aside>
<p>Particularly if you are playing in person, it is useful to either have cards with these written on them, or to freehand them on strips of paper when they come up, and hand them to the player as a tangible reminder of the impact. That way they are tracking it not you.</p>
</aside>
<p>The impact of actions taken by the players or NPCs may have more lasting impacts on other characters. This could include things like being bruised from a punch, or blinded by flight, or drunk. To represent these, the characters impacted should have a negative modifier to one or more of their attributes until it goes away. Although examples are listed bellow they are not exhaustive.</p>
<table class="a">
  <tr>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Impact</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hurt or Wounded</td>
    <td>-1 to BRN &amp; ATH</td>

<H1>Setting Rules</H1>
<p>These are specific rules to use when making up your own settings or to customize your game.</p>
<H2>Weaker Mooks</H2>
<p>For settings where anyone who isn't a named characters can be expected to hit any part of a barn. Instead of rolling 1D6+3 either roll 1D6+2 or 1D10.</p>
